               <p>In 2012, they made it illegal to unlock our own phones. But we stood up to them, and President Obama agreed with us. We got a law passed. Now the Copyright Office is considering taking that freedom away again.</p>

               <p>Copyright law is shaping up to be the next big battleground in technology. It's fundamentally redefining ownership. But there's something you can do about it. <strong>Right now.</strong></p>
               <p>Big companies have stepped in and opposed our freedom requests.  They told the Copyright Office that consumers like you don't really need or want to tinker with, repair, and modify certain devices. We need specific examples from you to show the Copyright Office that manufacturers are wrong.</p>

               <p><a href="http://copyright.gov/1201/comment-forms/">They sure did,</a> but it's almost impossible to use. You can see their <a href="http://copyright.gov/1201/comment-forms/">cumbersome form here</a> if you scroll far enough. You have to upload a Word document and they make it especially difficult to comment on more than one exemption.</p>

               <p>So we made their form better.</p>

               <p>In another awesome turn of events, the Copyright Office is also accepting video submissions! If you want to have an extra special impact, record your comments and burn your video to a DVD. Then and mail it to:</p>

               <p>Software is eating the world. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/03/you-dont-own-your-cellphones-or-your-cars/">Copyright is impacting more people than ever before</a> because the line between hardware and software, physical and digital has blurred. This is a property rights issue, and current copyright law gets it backwards, turning regular people — like students, researchers, and small business owners — into criminals.</p>
